# Unimplemented Plans Directory

## Purpose

This directory is reserved for documentation of features and improvements that have been **planned but not yet implemented** or are in **early implementation stages** (less than 85% complete).

## Current Status

**EMPTY** - All previously unimplemented plans have been verified and moved to appropriate locations:

- **Enhanced Logging Implementation Plan** → `../archived/completed-implementations/enhanced-logging/` (85-90% implemented)
- **Membership Dues System Detailed Plan** → `../archived/completed-implementations/membership-dues/` (85-90% implemented)

## Future Use

This directory will contain:
- New feature proposals and specifications
- Implementation plans in early development stages
- Research documents for potential improvements
- Plans awaiting resource allocation or approval

## Migration Criteria

Plans are moved from this directory when they reach:
- **85%+ implementation**: Move to `../archived/completed-implementations/[topic]/`
- **100% implementation**: Mark as "COMPLETED"
- **Superseded**: Move to `../archived/superseded-versions/`
- **Cancelled**: Move to `../archived/cancelled-plans/` (if created)

## Organization

When this directory contains files, they should be organized by:
- Topic area (matching existing system modules)
- Implementation priority (high/medium/low)
- Resource requirements
- Dependencies and prerequisites

## Verification Process

Plans in this directory undergo periodic verification to:
1. Check actual implementation status in codebase
2. Verify against current system functionality
3. Assess completion percentage
4. Move to appropriate archive locations when substantially implemented

## Last Verification

**Date**: August 4, 2025
**Process**: Phase 1C Deep Implementation Verification
**Result**: All plans verified as substantially implemented and archived
**Next Review**: As new plans are added to this directory
