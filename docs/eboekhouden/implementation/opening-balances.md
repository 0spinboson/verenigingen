# Opening Balance Import

## Overview

The eBoekhouden integration includes comprehensive opening balance import functionality with advanced features for stock account handling, automatic balancing, and error recovery.

## Key Features (2025 Enhancements)

### ✅ Automatic Stock Account Detection
The system automatically detects and properly handles stock accounts during opening balance imports.

**Stock Account Exclusion**:
```python
def is_stock_account(account):
    """Detect stock accounts that cannot be updated via Journal Entry"""
    try:
        account_doc = frappe.get_doc("Account", account)
        return account_doc.account_type == "Stock"
    except frappe.DoesNotExistError:
        return False
```

**Why Stock Accounts are Excluded**:
- ERPNext restricts stock accounts to Stock transactions only
- Journal Entries cannot directly update stock account balances
- Stock reconciliation is the proper method for stock opening balances
- System provides detailed logging of excluded accounts

### ✅ Automatic Balancing
Prevents migration failures from unbalanced opening balance entries.

**Balancing Logic**:
```python
def create_balancing_entry(balance_difference, company, cost_center):
    """Create automatic balancing entry for opening balances"""
    # Get or create temporary difference account
    temp_account = _get_or_create_temporary_diff_account(company)

    balancing_entry = {
        "account": temp_account,
        "debit_in_account_currency": max(0, -balance_difference) if balance_difference < 0 else 0,
        "credit_in_account_currency": max(0, balance_difference) if balance_difference > 0 else 0,
        "cost_center": cost_center,
        "user_remark": "Automatic balancing entry for opening balances",
    }
    return balancing_entry
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates "Opening balance entries do not balance" errors
- Creates transparent audit trail of balancing adjustments
- Uses proper "Temporary" account type for differences
- Maintains accounting integrity while enabling successful imports

### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for account access and validation issues.

**Error Recovery**:
```python
def validate_account_for_opening_balance(account):
    """Validate account before including in opening balance"""
    try:
        account_doc = frappe.get_doc("Account", account)

        # Check account type restrictions
        if account_doc.account_type == "Stock":
            return False, "Stock account - not allowed in opening balances"

        # Check root type for P&L exclusion
        if account_doc.root_type in ["Income", "Expense"]:
            return False, "P&L account - excluded from opening balances"

        return True, "Valid for opening balance"

    except frappe.DoesNotExistError:
        return False, "Account not found in ERPNext"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error accessing account: {str(e)}"
```

## Import Process

### Step 1: Data Collection
The system collects opening balance data from eBoekhouden:

1. **Fetch opening mutations** from eBoekhouden API
2. **Extract account balances** for the opening date
3. **Validate account existence** in ERPNext
4. **Filter accounts** based on type and eligibility

### Step 2: Account Validation
Each account goes through comprehensive validation:

```python
validation_results = {
    "valid_accounts": [],      # Accounts included in opening balance
    "stock_accounts": [],      # Stock accounts (excluded)
    "pnl_accounts": [],        # P&L accounts (excluded)
    "missing_accounts": [],    # Accounts not found in ERPNext
    "error_accounts": []       # Accounts with access errors
}
```

### Step 3: Balance Calculation
The system calculates and validates balance totals:

1. **Sum all debit balances**
2. **Sum all credit balances**
3. **Calculate difference** (if any)
4. **Create balancing entry** if needed

### Step 4: Journal Entry Creation
Creates a comprehensive opening balance journal entry:

```python
opening_balance_entry = {
    "doctype": "Journal Entry",
    "voucher_type": "Opening Balance",
    "company": company,
    "posting_date": opening_date,
    "cost_center": cost_center,
    "user_remark": "Opening balances imported from eBoekhouden",
    "accounts": journal_entry_accounts,
    "eboekhouden_import_date": frappe.utils.now(),
    "is_opening": "Yes"
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration
Set up opening balance import in E-Boekhouden Settings:

```
Opening Balance Settings:
├── Enable Opening Balance Import: Yes
├── Opening Balance Date: [Auto-detected or manual]
├── Auto-Balance Entries: Yes (recommended)
└── Skip Stock Accounts: Yes (recommended)
```

### Advanced Options
For specialized requirements:

```python
# Import opening balances only (without full migration)
def import_opening_balances_only(company=None, opening_date=None):
    """Import only opening balance data"""

# Custom opening balance date
opening_date = "2024-01-01"  # Override auto-detected date

# Specific account filtering
account_filters = {
    "exclude_account_types": ["Stock"],
    "include_root_types": ["Asset", "Liability", "Equity"]
}
```

## Detailed Reporting

### Opening Balance Report
The system provides comprehensive reporting of the opening balance import:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "journal_entry": "JE-2025-00001",
    "opening_date": "2024-01-01",
    "accounts_processed": 45,
    "total_debit": 125000.00,
    "total_credit": 125000.00,
    "balanced": true,
    "balancing_entry_created": false,
    "skipped_accounts": {
        "stock": [
            {"account": "Stock Account - Company", "balance": 5000.00}
        ],
        "pnl": [
            {"account": "Sales - Company", "type": "Income"},
            {"account": "Cost of Goods Sold - Company", "type": "Expense"}
        ],
        "errors": []
    },
    "performance_stats": {
        "processing_time": "2.3 seconds",
        "accounts_per_second": 19.6
    }
}
```

### Audit Trail
Complete audit trail of opening balance processing:

1. **Source data**: eBoekhouden opening balance mutations
2. **Account validation**: Results for each account
3. **Balance calculations**: Debit/credit totals and differences
4. **Balancing entries**: Details of any balancing adjustments
5. **Final journal entry**: Complete transaction record

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Stock accounts found in opening balances"
**Solution**: ✅ **Automatically handled**
- Stock accounts are automatically detected and skipped
- Detailed logging shows which accounts were excluded
- No manual intervention required

#### Issue: "Opening balance entries do not balance"
**Solution**: ✅ **Automatically handled**
- System automatically creates balancing entries
- Uses "Temporary" account type for differences
- Maintains complete audit trail of balancing logic

#### Issue: "Account not found in ERPNext"
**Solution**:
1. Import chart of accounts first before opening balances
2. Check account mapping configuration
3. Verify company is correctly set in settings

#### Issue: "P&L accounts included in opening balances"
**Solution**: ✅ **Automatically handled**
- P&L accounts (Income/Expense) are automatically excluded
- Only Balance Sheet accounts (Asset/Liability/Equity) are included
- Detailed reporting shows which accounts were excluded

### Validation Tools

#### Pre-Import Validation
```python
# Validate opening balance data before import
def validate_opening_balance_data():
    """Validate opening balance data before processing"""
    validation_report = {
        "total_accounts": 150,
        "valid_accounts": 120,
        "stock_accounts": 10,
        "pnl_accounts": 15,
        "missing_accounts": 5,
        "estimated_balance_difference": 0.00
    }
    return validation_report
```

#### Post-Import Validation
```python
# Validate imported opening balances
def validate_imported_opening_balances():
    """Validate opening balances after import"""
    trial_balance = generate_trial_balance(opening_date)

    # Compare with eBoekhouden source data
    validation_results = {
        "trial_balance_matches": True,
        "total_assets": 85000.00,
        "total_liabilities": 25000.00,
        "total_equity": 60000.00,
        "balance_sheet_balanced": True
    }
    return validation_results
```

## Best Practices

### Before Opening Balance Import
1. **Complete ERPNext setup**: Ensure company and chart of accounts are configured
2. **Backup database**: Always backup before importing opening balances
3. **Test connectivity**: Verify eBoekhouden API connection is working
4. **Review opening date**: Confirm the opening balance date is correct

### During Import
1. **Monitor progress**: Watch for any error messages or warnings
2. **Review skipped accounts**: Check which accounts were excluded and why
3. **Validate balancing**: Confirm any balancing entries are reasonable
4. **Check performance**: Monitor system resources during large imports

### After Import
1. **Generate trial balance**: Verify trial balance for opening date
2. **Compare totals**: Compare with eBoekhouden opening balance reports
3. **Review journal entry**: Examine the created opening balance journal entry
4. **Test workflows**: Verify ERPNext workflows work with imported data
