# Or specifically import role profiles
bench --site [sitename] import-doc ~/frappe-bench/apps/verenigingen/verenigingen/fixtures/role_profile.json
bench --site [sitename] import-doc ~/frappe-bench/apps/verenigingen/verenigingen/fixtures/module_profile.json
```

### Auto-Assignment Script

Use the provided script to automatically assign role profiles based on existing user roles:

```python
# From bench console
from verenigingen.setup.role_profile_setup import auto_assign_role_profiles
auto_assign_role_profiles()
```

### Manual Assignment

1. Go to User List
2. Select a user
3. In the Role Profile section, add the appropriate Verenigingen role profile
4. Save

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the minimum required access** - Users can always be upgraded to higher profiles
2. **Use role profiles consistently** - Don't mix individual role assignments with profiles
3. **Regular review** - Audit role assignments quarterly
4. **Document exceptions** - If custom roles are needed, document why
5. **Test thoroughly** - Verify access levels before rolling out to users

## Customization

If you need to modify role profiles:

1. Export current profiles: `bench --site [sitename] export-fixtures --app verenigingen`
2. Edit the JSON files in `verenigingen/fixtures/`
3. Re-import: `bench --site [sitename] import-fixtures --app verenigingen`
4. Test with sample users before widespread deployment

## Troubleshooting

### User can't access expected features
1. Check if role profile is properly assigned
2. Verify module profile is linked to role profile
3. Clear cache: `bench --site [sitename] clear-cache`
4. Check individual role permissions

### Too much access
1. Review assigned role profiles (users might have multiple)
2. Check for individually assigned roles outside profiles
3. Verify module profile restrictions are working

### Module not visible
1. Check if module is included in the module profile
2. Verify the module is installed and enabled
3. Check module-level permissions
