## Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Data Quality Checks**:
   ```bash
   bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute verenigingen.utils.debug.coverage_analysis_debugger.quick_coverage_test
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor query execution times
   - Check error logs for processing issues
   - Validate data consistency

3. **Coverage Field Population**:
   ```bash
   bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute verenigingen.utils.debug.coverage_analysis_debugger.populate_coverage_dates
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Issue**: Member shows 0% coverage despite having invoices
   - **Cause**: Invoices missing coverage dates
   - **Solution**: Run `populate_coverage_dates()` function

2. **Issue**: Incorrect gap calculations
   - **Cause**: Overlapping membership periods
   - **Solution**: Review membership data for date conflicts

3. **Issue**: Performance degradation
   - **Cause**: Large date ranges or many members
   - **Solution**: Use filters to limit scope

### Debug Functions

```bash
# Full system debug
bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute verenigingen.utils.debug.coverage_analysis_debugger.run_full_debug

# Quick member test
bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute verenigingen.utils.debug.coverage_analysis_debugger.quick_coverage_test --args "['MEM-001']"
