## Usage Examples

### Applying Optimizations to New Endpoints

```python
@frappe.whitelist()
@handle_api_error
@performance_monitor(threshold_ms=1000)
@require_roles(["System Manager", "Verenigingen Administrator"])
@rate_limit(max_requests=10, window_minutes=60)
def new_api_endpoint(param1, param2):
    """New API endpoint with all optimizations"""

    # Validate inputs
    validate_required_fields(
        {"param1": param1, "param2": param2},
        ["param1", "param2"]
    )

    param1 = APIValidator.sanitize_text(param1, max_length=100)
    param2 = APIValidator.validate_email(param2)

    # Your business logic here

    return {"success": True, "message": "Operation completed"}
```

### Using Enhanced Testing Framework

```python
class TestNewFeature(VerenigingenTestCase):
    def test_new_functionality(self):
        # Automatic test data creation and cleanup
        member = self.create_test_member()

        # Performance assertion
        result = self.assert_performance(
            lambda: my_function(member.name),
            max_time_ms=500
        )

        # N+1 query detection
        self.assert_no_n_plus_one_queries(
            my_bulk_function,
            [member1, member2, member3]
        )
```

### Monitoring Performance

```python
# Get performance dashboard
dashboard_data = get_performance_dashboard()

# Get system health
health_status = get_system_health()

# Get optimization suggestions
suggestions = get_optimization_suggestions()
```
