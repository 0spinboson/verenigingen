## Enhanced Testing Framework

### VereningingenTestCase (New Standard)
All tests should inherit from `VereningingenTestCase` which provides:

```python
from verenigingen.tests.utils.base import VereningingenTestCase

class TestMyFeature(VereningingenTestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        super().setUp()
        # Automatic cleanup and factory methods available

    def test_something(self):
        # Use factory methods
        member = self.create_test_member(
            first_name="Test",
            last_name="User",
            email="test@example.com"
        )
        # Automatic cleanup handled by base class
```

#### Key Features:
- **Automatic Document Cleanup**: All created documents tracked and cleaned up automatically
- **Customer Cleanup**: Automatic customer record cleanup for member-related tests
- **Factory Methods**: Consistent test data generation with proper relationships
- **Permission Compliance**: No `ignore_permissions=True` violations
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in query count and execution time monitoring
- **Enhanced Assertions**: Domain-specific assertions for common test patterns

#### Factory Methods Available:
```python
# Core entities
member = self.create_test_member(first_name="John", email="john@example.com")
volunteer = self.create_test_volunteer(member=member.name)
chapter = self.create_test_chapter(chapter_name="Test Chapter")
membership = self.create_test_membership(member=member.name)

# Banking and payments
mandate = self.create_sepa_mandate(member=member.name, bank_code="TEST")
iban = self.factory.generate_test_iban("TEST")  # Valid test IBAN with checksum
```

### Test Organization (2025 Reorganization)

#### Test Categories:
- **`backend/business_logic/`**: Core business logic and critical functionality
- **`backend/components/`**: Individual component and feature tests
- **`backend/integration/`**: Cross-system integration tests
- **`backend/workflows/`**: Complex multi-step process tests
- **`backend/validation/`**: Data validation and schema tests
- **`frontend/`**: JavaScript and UI component tests

#### Migration Status:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: Critical business logic tests migrated to VereningingenTestCase
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 Complete**: Core component tests migrated with factory methods
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 Complete**: Workflow and integration tests migrated
- üöß **Ongoing**: Permission violation cleanup across remaining test files

### Mock Bank Testing Support
Enhanced testing with realistic but clearly marked test data:

```python
# Generate valid test IBANs with proper MOD-97 checksums
test_iban = generate_test_iban("TEST")  # NL13TEST0123456789
mock_iban = generate_test_iban("MOCK")  # NL82MOCK0123456789
demo_iban = generate_test_iban("DEMO")  # NL93DEMO0123456789

# All pass full IBAN validation and work with SEPA mandate creation
```

## DocType Architecture

### Key Document Types

#### Member Management:
- **Member**: Core member records with mixin pattern for specialized functionality
- **Membership**: Lifecycle management with custom subscription overrides
- **Membership Application**: Review workflow with geographic assignment

#### Financial Integration:
- **SEPA Mandate**: Direct debit authorization with enhanced validation
- **Direct Debit Batch**: SEPA file generation and processing
- **Payment Entry**: ERPNext integration for payment tracking

#### Organizational Structure:
- **Chapter**: Geographic organization with postal code validation
- **Team**: Project-based volunteer organization
- **Volunteer**: Assignment tracking and expense management

### Mixin Pattern Implementation
Key doctypes use specialized mixins for enhanced functionality:

```python
# Member uses multiple mixins for specialized operations
class Member:
    # PaymentMixin: SEPA mandate and payment processing
    # SEPAMandateMixin: Direct debit management
    # ChapterMixin: Geographic chapter assignment
    # TerminationMixin: Governance-compliant termination workflows
```

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards

#### Frappe ORM Compliance:
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct: Use Frappe ORM
doc = frappe.new_doc("DocType")
doc.field1 = "value"
doc.save()  # Let Frappe validate

# ‚ùå Never: Direct SQL manipulation
frappe.db.sql("INSERT INTO ...")  # Bypasses validation
```

#### Permission Compliance:
```python
# ‚úÖ Correct: Use proper permissions
doc.insert()  # Respects role permissions

# ‚ùå Never: Bypass permissions in production code
doc.insert(ignore_permissions=True)  # Only for test setup
```

#### Field Reference Validation:
```python
# ‚úÖ Always read DocType JSON first
# Check required fields: "reqd": 1
# Use exact field names from JSON
# Never guess field names
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Mandatory Test Patterns:
1. **Use VereningingenTestCase**: All new tests must inherit from enhanced base class
2. **Factory Methods**: Use provided factory methods for consistent test data
3. **Document Tracking**: Use `self.track_doc()` for automatic cleanup
4. **No Permission Bypassing**: Remove all `ignore_permissions=True` violations
5. **DocType Validation**: Read JSON files before writing tests that create documents

#### Test Execution:
```bash
# Use Frappe test runner
bench --site dev.veganisme.net run-tests --app verenigingen --module test_module

# Never use direct Python execution (will fail with import errors)
python test_file.py  # ‚ùå Fails with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'frappe'"
```
