# ANBI Phase 2: Periodic Donation Agreement System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Periodic Donation Agreement system for ANBI compliance, enabling 5-year donation commitments with full tax deductibility for Dutch donors.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New DocTypes Created

#### Periodic Donation Agreement
Main doctype for managing 5-year donation agreements with the following features:
- **Auto-generated agreement numbers** (format: PDA-YYYY-#####)
- **5-year period enforcement** with automatic end date calculation
- **Payment frequency management** (Monthly/Quarterly/Annually)
- **Automatic payment amount calculation** based on annual commitment
- **Donation tracking** with running totals and counts
- **Status management** (Draft/Active/Completed/Cancelled)
- **SEPA mandate integration** for direct debit payments
- **Email notifications** for confirmations and expiry warnings

#### Periodic Donation Agreement Item
Child table for tracking individual donations linked to agreements:
- Links to actual Donation documents
- Tracks payment status (Paid/Unpaid/Failed/Refunded)
- Receipt tracking capabilities

### 2. Enhanced Donation DocType
Added integration with periodic agreements:
- New field: `periodic_donation_agreement` (Link to Periodic Donation Agreement)
- Automatic validation ensuring donor consistency
- Auto-population of ANBI fields from linked agreement
- Automatic marking as Belastingdienst reportable

### 3. API Endpoints Created
Comprehensive API in `periodic_donation_operations.py`:
- `create_periodic_agreement()` - Create new agreements
- `get_donor_agreements()` - List donor's agreements
- `link_donation_to_agreement()` - Link existing donations
- `generate_periodic_donation_report()` - ANBI reporting
- `check_expiring_agreements()` - Monitor expiring agreements
- `create_donation_from_agreement()` - Generate donations from agreements
- `get_agreement_statistics()` - Overall system statistics

### 4. Client-Side Functionality
JavaScript interface (`periodic_donation_agreement.js`):
- Agreement activation workflow
- Donation linking dialog
- Agreement cancellation with reason tracking
- Real-time statistics display
- Visual progress indicators
- CSV export for reports

### 5. Business Logic Implementation
- **BSN eleven-proof validation** maintained from Phase 1
- **5-year minimum period enforcement**
- **Donor verification checks** when creating agreements
- **Automatic calculation** of payment schedules
- **Email notifications** at key lifecycle points
- **Comprehensive audit trail** for all operations

## Key Features

### Agreement Lifecycle Management
1. **Creation**: Draft agreements with full validation
2. **Activation**: Move to Active status with checks
3. **Donation Tracking**: Real-time tracking of linked donations
4. **Expiry Management**: Automatic notifications at 90/60/30 days
5. **Cancellation**: Structured cancellation with reason tracking

### ANBI Compliance Features
- Enforces 5-year minimum commitment period
- Links donations to agreements for tax reporting
- Maintains full audit trail for Belastingdienst
- Generates compliant reports with agreement details
- Tracks notarial vs private written agreements

### Integration Points
- **SEPA Mandates**: Direct debit integration for recurring payments
- **Email System**: Automated notifications and confirmations
- **Reporting System**: Comprehensive ANBI report generation
- **Donor Management**: Full integration with donor records

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite in `test_periodic_donation_agreement.py`:
- Agreement creation and validation
- Payment amount calculations
- Donation linking functionality
- Agreement number generation
- Donor mismatch prevention
- Next donation date calculations
- Agreement cancellation workflow
- SEPA mandate integration

## Security Considerations
- Maintains field-level permissions from Phase 1
- Agreement modifications require appropriate roles
- Sensitive data remains encrypted
- Audit trail for all agreement changes
- Validation prevents cross-donor contamination

## Next Steps (Phase 3-5)
1. **Phase 3**: Build comprehensive ANBI reporting dashboards
2. **Phase 4**: Create donor self-service portal
3. **Phase 5**: Implement automated Belastingdienst submission

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Periodic Agreement
```python
# Via API
result = frappe.call('verenigingen.api.periodic_donation_operations.create_periodic_agreement', {
    'donor': 'DN-0001',
    'annual_amount': 1200,
    'payment_frequency': 'Monthly',
    'payment_method': 'SEPA Direct Debit',
    'agreement_type': 'Private Written'
})
```

### Linking Donations
Donations can be linked to agreements either:
1. At creation time by setting `periodic_donation_agreement` field
2. After creation using the "Link Donation" action in the agreement form
3. Via API using `link_donation_to_agreement()`

### Generating Reports
```python
# Generate ANBI report for all periodic agreements
report = frappe.call('verenigingen.api.periodic_donation_operations.generate_periodic_donation_report', {
    'from_date': '2024-01-01',
    'to_date': '2024-12-31'
})
```

## Technical Notes
- Agreement numbers use format PDA-YYYY-##### for easy identification
- Email templates use HTML format for better presentation
- Child table pattern used for flexible donation tracking
- Proper transaction handling ensures data consistency
- Framework-level validations prevent data corruption

## Migration Requirements
After installation, run:
```bash
bench --site [site-name] migrate
```

This creates the necessary database tables and updates the Donation doctype.
