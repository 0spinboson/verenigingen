# ANBI Compliance Development Roadmap

## Current State Assessment

The donation module currently has basic ANBI awareness but lacks critical features for full compliance with Dutch tax regulations. This document outlines the required development to achieve complete ANBI compliance.

### Existing ANBI Features
- ✅ Basic ANBI agreement number and date fields
- ✅ Automatic flagging of donations > €500 as reportable
- ✅ ANBI agreement number generator (ANBI-YYYY-NNN format)
- ✅ Email template for ANBI tax receipts
- ⚠️ Basic reporting data generation (incomplete)
- ❌ PDF receipt generation (placeholder only)

### Critical Missing Features
- ❌ BSN/RSIN storage for donor identification
- ❌ Periodic donation agreement system (5-year commitments)
- ❌ Compliant export formats for Belastingdienst
- ❌ Proper security for sensitive tax data
- ❌ Complete audit trail for ANBI operations

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Data Infrastructure (Priority: HIGH)
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

#### 1.1 Enhance Donor Doctype
```python
# Add fields to Donor doctype:
- bsn_citizen_service_number (Data, encrypted)

- identification_verified (Check)
- identification_verification_date (Date)
- identification_verification_method (Select: "DigiD", "Manual", "Other")
- anbi_consent (Check) # Consent to use data for ANBI reporting
- anbi_consent_date (Datetime)
```

#### 1.2 Security Implementation
- Implement field-level encryption for BSN/RSIN

#### 1.3 Privacy Compliance
- Add GDPR-compliant consent tracking
- Implement data retention policies
- Create data export/deletion capabilities
- Add privacy impact assessment documentation

### Phase 2: Periodic Donation System (Priority: HIGH)
**Timeline: 3-4 weeks**

#### 2.1 Create Periodic Donation Agreement Doctype
```python
# New doctype: Periodic Donation Agreement

- donor (Link to Donor)
- start_date (Date, mandatory)
- end_date (Date, auto-calculated: start_date + 5 years)
- annual_amount (Currency, mandatory)
- payment_frequency (Select: "Monthly", "Quarterly", "Annually")
- payment_method (Select: "SEPA", "Bank Transfer", "Other")
- sepa_mandate (Link to SEPA Mandate, optional)
- agreement_type (Select: "Notarial", "Private Written")
- agreement_document (Attach)
- status (Select: "Draft", "Active", "Completed", "Cancelled")
- cancellation_reason (Text, optional)
- donations (Table of linked donations)
```

#### 2.2 Agreement Generation System
- Create agreement templates for private written agreements
- Generate PDF agreements with all required legal text
- Include donor and organization details
- Add signature fields and dating
- Store signed agreements securely

#### 2.3 Periodic Donation Tracking
- Link individual donations to periodic agreements
- Track progress toward annual commitments
- Generate reminders for missing payments
- Alert when agreements near expiration
- Handle early termination scenarios

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Reporting (Priority: HIGH)
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

#### 3.1 Belastingdienst Export Formats
- Research exact XML/CSV format requirements
- Create export function matching Belastingdienst specifications
- Include all required fields: BSN/RSIN, amounts, dates, agreement numbers
- Separate reporting for one-off vs periodic donations
- Implement data validation before export

#### 3.2 ANBI Receipt Generation
```python
def generate_anbi_receipt_pdf(donation):
    """Generate official ANBI tax receipt PDF"""
    # Include:
    # - Organization ANBI details and RSIN
    # - Donor information (name, address)
    # - Donation details (amount, date, purpose)
    # - For periodic: agreement number and period
    # - Legal text about tax deductibility
    # - Organization signature/stamp
    # - Unique receipt number
    return pdf_file
```

#### 3.3 Reporting Dashboard
- Annual ANBI donation summaries
- Periodic vs one-off donation breakdowns
- Donor analytics (while respecting privacy)
- Compliance status indicators
- Export queue management

### Phase 4: Compliance Automation (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Timeline: 2 weeks**

#### 4.1 Automated Compliance Checks

- Check donation thresholds and limits
- Validate periodic agreement requirements
- Flag non-compliant donations
- Generate compliance reports

#### 4.2 Donor Communication

- Handle donations to multiple ANBI organizations
- Consolidated reporting across organizations
- Inter-organization fund transfers
- Shared donor database (with consent)

#### 5.2 Advanced Analytics
- Donation prediction models
- Donor lifetime value calculations
- Campaign effectiveness metrics
- Tax benefit calculations for donors

## Implementation Considerations

### Security Requirements
1. **Encryption**: Use field-level encryption for BSN/RSIN storage
2. **Access Control**: Implement strict role-based access
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all access to sensitive data
4. **Data Masking**: Show only partial BSN/RSIN in UI
5. **Secure Transmission**: Use HTTPS for all data transfers

### Legal Compliance
1. **GDPR**: Ensure all personal data handling is compliant
2. **Dutch Tax Law**: Stay updated with regulation changes
3. **Data Retention**: Implement 7-year retention for tax data
4. **Consent Management**: Track and respect donor preferences

### Testing Requirements
1. **Unit Tests**: Cover all ANBI-related functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test reporting and export functions
3. **Security Tests**: Verify encryption and access controls
4. **Compliance Tests**: Validate against ANBI requirements
5. **User Acceptance**: Test with actual ANBI organizations

### Documentation Needs
1. **User Guides**: How to manage ANBI donations
2. **Admin Guides**: System configuration for ANBI
3. **Compliance Guides**: Meeting ANBI requirements
4. **Security Guides**: Handling sensitive data
5. **API Documentation**: For integrations

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Senior Developer (security expertise)
- 1 Full-stack Developer
- 1 UI/UX Designer (for forms and receipts)
- 1 Compliance Consultant (Dutch tax law)
- 1 QA Engineer

### Timeline Summary
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks

- **Total: 11-15 weeks** for full ANBI compliance

### External Dependencies
- Legal review of agreement templates
- Belastingdienst format specifications
- Security audit of BSN/RSIN handling
- GDPR compliance review
- Dutch tax law updates

## Success Metrics
1. **Compliance Rate**: 100% of donations properly categorized
2. **Reporting Accuracy**: Zero errors in Belastingdienst exports
3. **Security**: Pass external security audit
4. **User Satisfaction**: 90%+ satisfaction with ANBI features
5. **Processing Time**: < 5 minutes for receipt generation

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Regulatory Changes**: Monitor tax law updates regularly
2. **Security Breaches**: Implement defense-in-depth strategy
3. **Performance Issues**: Design for scalability from start
4. **User Adoption**: Provide comprehensive training
5. **Integration Failures**: Build robust error handling

This roadmap provides a structured approach to achieving full ANBI compliance while maintaining security, usability, and legal compliance throughout the implementation.
