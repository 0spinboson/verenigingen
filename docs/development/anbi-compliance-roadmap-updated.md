- **Shorter Agreements**: Allow 1-4 year agreements (non-ANBI)
- **Longer Agreements**: Allow 6-10 year agreements
- **Configuration**: System setting for allowed durations
- **Validation**: Different rules for ANBI vs non-ANBI agreements

### 3.4 ANBI Reporting Dashboard

- Payment failure handling
- Identity verification failures
- Concurrent donation processing
- System limit testing (large datasets)
- Invalid data handling
- Permission boundary testing

### 4.4 Code Cleanup
- Remove all one-off test scripts
- Consolidate debug utilities
- Document all test commands
- Create test data factories
- Implement proper teardown

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Integration
**Timeline: 3-4 weeks**

### 5.1 Donor Self-Service Portal
- View/download agreements and receipts
- Update payment methods
- Track donation history
- Manage communication preferences
- Request agreement modifications

### 5.2 Automated Compliance
- Belastingdienst submission integration
- Automated verification workflows
- Compliance monitoring alerts
- Regulatory update tracking

### 5.3 Advanced Analytics
- Donor lifetime value tracking
- Predictive analytics for renewals
- Campaign effectiveness metrics
- Churn prediction and prevention

## Implementation Updates

### Web Form Requirements
1. **Donation Agreement Form**:
   - Progressive disclosure design
   - Real-time validation
   - Document preview capability
   - Mobile-responsive layout
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

2. **Donation Form**:
   - Single-page or wizard option
   - Payment method integration
   - Immediate confirmation
   - Social sharing options
   - Campaign tracking

### Workflow Design Principles
- Minimal manual intervention
- Clear audit trail
- Configurable notifications
- Role-based actions
- Exception handling

### Testing Strategy
- Test-driven development approach
- Continuous integration pipeline
- Automated regression testing
- Manual UAT with personas
- Security penetration testing

### Duration Flexibility Implementation
```python
# System settings for agreement duration
anbi_minimum_years = 5  # For tax deductibility
non_anbi_minimum_years = 1
maximum_agreement_years = 10

# Validation logic
def validate_agreement_duration(years, is_anbi):
    if is_anbi and years < anbi_minimum_years:
        return False, "ANBI agreements require minimum 5 years"
    elif not is_anbi and years < non_anbi_minimum_years:
        return False, "Agreements require minimum 1 year"
    elif years > maximum_agreement_years:
        return False, f"Maximum agreement duration is {maximum_agreement_years} years"
    return True, "Valid duration"
```

## Success Metrics (Updated)
1. **Web Form Conversion**: >60% completion rate
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: <24 hour average approval time
3. **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage
4. **User Satisfaction**: >85% for each persona
5. **Agreement Flexibility**: Support 1-10 year agreements
6. **Data Quality**: <1% validation errors

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Design web form wireframes

3. Set up test persona data
4. Implement duration configuration
5. Begin comprehensive test writing
6. Clean up existing test code

This updated roadmap incorporates all requested features while maintaining focus on ANBI compliance and user experience.
