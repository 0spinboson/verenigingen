## üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements Delivered

### Streamlined TestDataFactory
```python
# NEW: Enhanced factory with intelligent defaults
def create_test_member(self, **kwargs):
    """Create test member with realistic data and flexible overrides"""
    defaults = {
        "first_name": self.fake.first_name(),
        "last_name": self.fake.last_name(),
        "email": self.fake.email(),
        "birth_date": self.fake.date_of_birth(minimum_age=18, maximum_age=80),
        # ... intelligent defaults with Faker integration
    }
    defaults.update(kwargs)  # Easy customization
    # ... implementation
```

### Enhanced VereningingenTestCase
```python
# NEW: Convenience methods with automatic tracking
def create_test_member(self, **kwargs):
    """Create test member with automatic cleanup tracking"""
    member = self.factory.create_test_member(**kwargs)
    self.track_doc("Member", member.name)  # Auto cleanup
    return member
```

### Core Factory Methods (7 total)
1. `create_test_chapter(**kwargs)` - Single chapter with intelligent defaults
2. `create_test_member(**kwargs)` - Single member with realistic data
3. `create_test_membership(**kwargs)` - Single membership with relationships
4. `create_test_volunteer(**kwargs)` - Single volunteer with skills
5. `create_test_sepa_mandate(**kwargs)` - SEPA mandate with valid test IBAN
6. `create_test_expense(**kwargs)` - Volunteer expense with categories
7. `create_complete_test_scenario(**kwargs)` - Full business scenario
