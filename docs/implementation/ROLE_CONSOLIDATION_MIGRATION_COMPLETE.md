## Migration Verification

### **Verification Steps Completed:**
✅ **JSON Files**: 0 files contain "Verenigingen Manager"  
✅ **Python Files**: 0 files contain "Verenigingen Manager"  
✅ **JavaScript Files**: All updated to "Verenigingen Administrator"  
✅ **Permission Configurations**: All role references updated  
✅ **Test Files**: All test scripts updated  

### **Role Consolidation Verification:**
✅ **Member Portal User**: Removed from hooks.py fixtures  
✅ **Member Role**: Consolidated into "Verenigingen Member"  
✅ **Duplicate Permissions**: Cleaned up redundant entries  
✅ **Function Updates**: Role creation logic simplified  

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clarity**: Role names now clearly indicate their purpose and scope
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated 2 overlapping member roles  
3. **Simplified Management**: Fewer roles to assign and maintain
4. **Better User Experience**: Clear role hierarchy and permissions
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with consistent role references

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **System Restart**: Run `bench restart` to load new role configurations
2. **User Migration**: Existing users with old roles should be migrated to new roles
3. **Testing**: Verify all role-based permissions work correctly
4. **Documentation**: Update user-facing documentation with new role names

## Rollback Information

**Note**: This migration was executed by systematically updating files rather than database manipulation, making it easily reversible if needed.

**To Rollback (if necessary)**:
1. Reverse the role name changes in configuration files
2. Restore the original role creation logic  
3. Re-add the removed role fixtures
4. Restart the system

## Migration Script

**Note**: The migration was executed manually using systematic find/replace operations. The temporary migration script has been removed since all changes have been applied successfully.
