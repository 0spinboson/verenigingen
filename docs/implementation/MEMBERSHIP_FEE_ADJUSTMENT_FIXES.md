# Membership Fee Adjustment Page Fixes

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Deprecated Direct Dues Schedule Creation
- The `create_new_dues_schedule()` function has been deprecated and replaced with an error message
- This function was bypassing the Contribution Amendment Request workflow
- Any attempts to call this function will now throw an error directing users to use the proper workflow

### 2. Fixed Auto-Approval Logic
- Removed the immediate application of auto-approved amendments in `submit_fee_adjustment_request()`
- Auto-approved amendments are now handled by the scheduled task based on their effective date
- This ensures consistency with the intended business logic where amendments are applied on their effective date

### 3. Improved Status Handling
- The `submit_fee_adjustment_request()` function no longer sets the amendment status directly
- Instead, it relies on the Contribution Amendment Request's `before_insert()` method to determine the appropriate status
- This ensures that auto-approval rules are consistently applied based on the Verenigingen Settings

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better exception handling for both ValidationError and general exceptions
- Error messages are properly displayed to users with appropriate context
- Unexpected errors are logged for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

### 5. Proper Amendment Workflow
The correct workflow is now enforced:
1. User submits fee adjustment â†’ Creates Contribution Amendment Request
2. Amendment's `before_insert()` method determines if auto-approval is appropriate
3. Auto-approved amendments wait for their effective date to be applied
4. Manual approval amendments go through the approval process
5. All amendments are applied by the scheduled task `process_pending_amendments_daily()`
6. Dues schedules are only created by the amendment's `apply_amendment()` method

## Key Principles Enforced
- Never bypass the Contribution Amendment Request workflow
- Never create dues schedules directly from the member portal
- Always respect the effective date for applying amendments
- Ensure proper validation and error handling at all stages

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test fee increases within auto-approval limits
2. Test fee decreases requiring approval
3. Test edge cases (same amount, invalid amounts)
4. Verify scheduled task properly applies approved amendments
5. Confirm old direct dues schedule creation is blocked

## Files Modified
- `/home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/verenigingen/verenigingen/templates/pages/membership_fee_adjustment.py`

## Next Steps
1. Run `bench restart` to ensure changes are loaded
2. Test the fee adjustment page thoroughly
3. Monitor the scheduled task execution for amendment processing
4. Review any other code that might be creating dues schedules directly
