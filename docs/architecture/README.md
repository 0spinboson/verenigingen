## üìö Key Architectural Principles

Based on the documentation in this directory:

1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: All architectural changes backed by measurable data
2. **Phased Implementation**: Systematic 4-phase approach to major refactoring
3. **Service Layer Pattern**: Migration from direct database access to service layers
4. **Performance-First Design**: Measurable performance improvements as primary goals
5. **Security Integration**: Security considerations embedded in architectural decisions
6. **Monitoring-Driven Development**: Comprehensive monitoring as foundation for improvements

## üéØ Current Status

- **Phase 4 Complete**: Major architectural refactoring phases completed
- **Security Coverage**: 66.7% of high-risk APIs secured (ongoing improvement)
- **Performance Gains**: Significant but some claims require additional validation
- **Test Infrastructure**: Enhanced and measurably improved
- **Service Layer**: Migration ongoing with documented patterns

## üìà Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Measurable improvements in maintainability
- **Performance**: Documented performance gains in key areas
- **Security**: Systematic security framework implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with automated validation
- **Documentation**: Complete architectural documentation and guides
