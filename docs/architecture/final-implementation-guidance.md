        'avg_queries': 4.4,          # Current optimal query count
        'avg_response_time': 0.011,  # Current excellent response time
        'memory_usage_mb': 50        # Current memory usage
    }

    def validate_no_regression(self, current_metrics):
        """Automatically fail if performance degrades >5%"""
        # Implementation prevents any degradation
```
