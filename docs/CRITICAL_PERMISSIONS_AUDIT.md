# Critical Permissions Security Audit

## Executive Summary

Our automated permissions audit of 1,039 DocTypes has identified **450 potential security issues**, with several critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Public Financial Data Exposure

**DocTypes with UNRESTRICTED_PUBLIC_READ on financial data:**

| DocType | Risk Level | Current Access | Required Action |
|---------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Sales Invoice | **CRITICAL** | Public Read | Restrict to authorized roles only |
| POS Invoice | **CRITICAL** | Public Read | Restrict to authorized roles only |
| Purchase Invoice | **HIGH** | Public Read | Restrict to authorized roles only |
| Expense Claim | **HIGH** | Public Read | Owner + approver access only |
| Leave Application | **HIGH** | Public Read | Owner + HR access only |

**Impact**: Financial and personal data is accessible to anyone, including guests.

**Immediate Fixes Required:**
1. Remove public access from financial DocTypes
2. Implement proper role-based restrictions
3. Add server-side permission handlers for sensitive data

### 2. Sensitive Member Data Over-Exposure

**Member DocType Issues:**
- **9 roles** have read access (too broad for sensitive personal data)
- Includes financial information, personal details, payment history
- Should be restricted to: Owner, Admins, and authorized chapter officers only

**Current Roles with Access:**
- System Manager, Verenigingen Administrator, Verenigingen Manager
- Verenigingen Member, Sales User, Purchase User, Accounts User
- Website Manager, Employee

**Recommended Access:**
- System Manager, Verenigingen Administrator (full access)
- Verenigingen Member (own record only)
- Chapter officers (chapter members only)

### 3. Child Table Permission Issues

**374 DocTypes** have NO_READ_ACCESS, many are child tables that need read access for parent documents to function properly.

**Examples needing fixes:**
- Sales Invoice Item (child of Sales Invoice)
- Purchase Invoice Item (child of Purchase Invoice)
- Payment Entry Reference (child of Payment Entry)
- Member Payment History (child of Member)

## üìã SECURITY FIX PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: Critical Financial Data (This Week)
1. **Sales Invoice, POS Invoice, Purchase Invoice**
   - Remove public access
   - Implement role-based permissions
   - Add query conditions for company/user filtering

2. **Member DocType**
   - Reduce role access to essential only
   - Implement user permission system
   - Add chapter-based filtering

### Priority 2: Personal Data Protection (Next Week)
1. **Employee-related DocTypes**
   - Expense Claim, Leave Application, Employee Checkin
   - Implement owner-based access
   - Add manager/HR approval workflows

2. **Communication & File Access**
   - Communication, File, Notification Log
   - Add owner/participant-based restrictions

### Priority 3: Child Table Fixes (Following Week)
1. **Child table permissions**
   - Grant read access where needed for functionality
   - Inherit parent permissions where appropriate

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED PERMISSION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Financial Documents (Sales/Purchase Invoices)
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "role": "System Manager",
      "read": 1, "write": 1, "create": 1, "delete": 1
    },
    {
      "role": "Accounts Manager",
      "read": 1, "write": 1, "create": 1, "submit": 1
    },
    {
      "role": "Accounts User",
      "read": 1, "write": 1, "create": 1,
      "user_permission_doctypes": "[\"Company\"]"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pattern 2: Personal Data (Member, Employee)
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "role": "System Manager",
      "read": 1, "write": 1, "create": 1
    },
    {
      "role": "Verenigingen Member",
      "read": 1, "write": 1,
      "if_owner": 1
    }
  ]
}
```
**Plus server-side handler for chapter-based access**

### Pattern 3: Child Tables
**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING: Do not assign permissions directly to Child DocTypes.**

Child DocTypes inherit access permissions from their parent documents. Adding explicit child permissions can create security vulnerabilities by exposing sensitive line-item data through indirect access.

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**
- **Default**: No explicit permissions on child DocTypes
- **Parent inheritance**: Child tables automatically inherit permissions from parent documents
- **Exception handling**: Only add explicit child permissions in exceptional, documented cases
- **Never use public roles**: Never assign permissions to "All", "Guest", or broad roles on child tables

**‚ùå DANGEROUS PATTERN (DO NOT USE):**
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "role": "All",      // ‚Üê SECURITY RISK: Exposes child data
      "read": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ SECURE PATTERN:**
```
// No permissions needed - child inherits from parent
// If exceptional case requires explicit permissions:
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "role": "System Manager",  // ‚Üê Minimal necessary role only
      "read": 1
    }
  ]
}
// + Documented justification for the exception
```

## üîç IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Week 1: Critical Financial Fixes
- [ ] Audit and fix Sales Invoice permissions
- [ ] Audit and fix POS Invoice permissions
- [ ] Audit and fix Purchase Invoice permissions
- [ ] Test all financial workflows still work

### Week 2: Member Data Security
- [ ] Implement Member permission handler
- [ ] Add chapter-based filtering
- [ ] Test member portal access
- [ ] Verify admin access still works

### Week 3: Personal Data Protection
- [ ] Fix Expense Claim permissions
- [ ] Fix Leave Application permissions
- [ ] Fix Employee-related DocTypes
- [ ] Test HR workflows

### Week 4: Child Table Cleanup
- [ ] Fix child table read permissions
- [ ] Test parent-child functionality
- [ ] Verify report access works
- [ ] Clean up unnecessary permissions

## üìä MONITORING & VALIDATION

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero public access to financial data
- [ ] Member data restricted to authorized users only
- [ ] All business workflows still functional
- [ ] No broken parent-child relationships

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test as different user roles
- [ ] Verify portal access works correctly
- [ ] Check all reports still load
- [ ] Validate workflow submissions work
- [ ] Confirm no unauthorized data access

## üö¶ RISK ASSESSMENT

**Current Risk Level: HIGH**
- Financial data publicly accessible
- Personal data over-exposed
- Multiple compliance violations possible

**Target Risk Level: LOW**
- Data access properly restricted
- Role-based permissions enforced
- Audit trail maintained

## üìû ESCALATION

If any business process breaks during fixes:
1. **Document the issue** with specific error messages
2. **Revert the specific change** causing the issue
3. **Implement alternative approach** (e.g., server-side handler)
4. **Test thoroughly** before re-deploying

**Remember**: Security is critical, but business continuity is also essential. All changes must be tested in development before production deployment.
