# Pre-commit Security Validation Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive pre-commit security validation system has been implemented to prevent insecure API endpoints from being committed and to maintain high security standards across the Vereinigingen application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Security Detection Tools

#### Insecure API Detector (`scripts/validation/security/insecure_api_detector.py`)

**Purpose**: Identifies API endpoints lacking proper security decorators

**Key Features**:
- **Comprehensive scanning** of all API files for `@frappe.whitelist()` functions
- **Pattern-based classification** to determine appropriate security levels
- **Risk factor detection** including SQL injection, permission bypasses, financial operations
- **Automatic security level recommendations** based on function names and operations
- **Fast execution** suitable for pre-commit usage (< 30 seconds)
- **Detailed remediation guidance** with complete code examples

**Security Classifications**:
- **Critical**: Financial operations, admin functions, data deletion
- **High**: Member data operations, batch operations, administrative functions
- **Medium**: Reporting, read-only operations, analytics
- **Low**: Health checks, status endpoints, utility functions
- **Public**: No authentication required

**Risk Pattern Detection**:
- SQL injection risks
- Data export operations
- File operation risks
- External API calls
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Permission bypass patterns
- Financial operation risks

#### API Security Framework Validator (`scripts/validation/security/api_security_validator.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates compliance with the security framework patterns

**Key Features**:
- **Framework compliance checking** for proper security decorator usage
- **Security pattern verification** including input validation, error handling
- **Documentation validation** ensuring proper function documentation
- **Implementation quality checks** detecting hardcoded secrets, permission bypasses
- **Performance impact analysis** estimating function complexity
- **Comprehensive scoring** (0-100) based on security compliance

**Validation Categories**:
- Framework compliance
- Security pattern implementation
- Input validation presence
- Error handling implementation
- Documentation quality
- Implementation best practices

### 2. Pre-commit Integration

#### Configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

**Security Validation Hooks**:
```yaml
- id: insecure-api-detector
  name: 🔒 Insecure API Endpoint Detection
  entry: python scripts/validation/security/insecure_api_detector.py
  files: '^verenigingen/api/.*\.py$'

- id: api-security-validator
  name: 🛡️  API Security Framework Validation

- Framework decorator requirements
- Performance monitoring settings

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "settings": {

    "fail_on_medium": false
  },
  "whitelisted_functions": [
    "get_security_framework_status",
    "analyze_api_security_status"
  ]
}
```

## Current Security Status

### Analysis Results (As of Implementation)

**Overall Statistics**:

**Issue Breakdown**:
- **Critical issues**: 60 (financial operations, admin functions)
- **High issues**: 126 (member data, batch operations)
- **Medium issues**: 26 (reporting, read operations)
- **Low issues**: 15 (utility functions)

### High-Priority Security Issues

**Critical Operations Missing Security**:
