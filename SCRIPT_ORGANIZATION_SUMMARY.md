## Organized Directory Structure

The scripts are now organized into a clear hierarchy:

```
scripts/
├── debug/                          # Debug and troubleshooting scripts
│   ├── board/                      # Board member debugging
│   ├── chapter/                    # Chapter debugging  
│   ├── employee/                   # Employee debugging
│   ├── fix_expense_claim_accounts.py
│   ├── debug_custom_amount.py
│   ├── debug_team_assignment.py
│   └── debug_volunteer_lookup.py
├── migration/                      # Data migration scripts

├── tools/                          # Developer tools and helpers
└── validation/                     # Feature and migration validation
    ├── features/
    └── migrations/
```

## Benefits of Organization

### 1. **Clear Categorization**
- Scripts are grouped by purpose (debug, test, setup, validation)
- Easy to find the right script for specific tasks
- Logical hierarchy reduces confusion

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Related scripts are co-located
- Easier to update and maintain similar functionality
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Better Documentation**
- Each category has its own README with usage examples
- Scripts are properly documented within their context
- Clear entry points for different types of work

### 4. **Enhanced Workflow**
- Test runners provide organized execution
- Debug scripts are easily accessible
- Setup scripts are clearly identified for initial configuration

## Root Directory Cleanup

The root directory is now clean with only essential files:
- `__init__.py` (Python package marker)
- Core configuration files (`.toml`, `.txt`, `.md`)
- Essential app directories (`verenigingen/`, `templates/`, `public/`, etc.)

## Updated Documentation

All README files have been updated to reflect the new organization:
- `scripts/README.md` - Main overview with usage examples
- `scripts/debug/README.md` - Debug script documentation
- `scripts/testing/README.md` - Test script documentation
- `scripts/setup/README.md` - Setup script documentation
- `scripts/validation/README.md` - Validation script documentation

## Testing Infrastructure

The organized testing structure now includes:
- **35+ integration tests** covering expense, membership, volunteer, and team functionality
- **Comprehensive test runners** for different suites (regression, ERPNext, volunteer portal)
- **Unit tests organized by component** (board, employee, expense, permissions, volunteer)
- **Frontend tests** for JavaScript functionality
- **Validation scripts** for feature completeness checking

## Future Script Addition Guidelines

When adding new scripts:

1. **Determine Purpose**: Debug, test, setup, validation, migration, or tool
2. **Choose Category**: Place in appropriate subdirectory
3. **Follow Naming**: Use descriptive names with prefixes (test_, debug_, setup_, validate_)
4. **Add Documentation**: Update relevant README files
5. **Include Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling and informative output

This organization provides a solid foundation for continued development and maintenance of the Verenigingen app's utility scripts.
