  Key Improvements Over Current State:

  1. Controller Testing: Direct testing of Python methods, not just doctypes
  2. API Coverage: Every whitelisted function gets tested
  3. Workflow Tests: Multi-stage scenarios that mirror real user journeys
  4. State Validation: Each stage validates expected state before proceeding
  5. Error Path Testing: Not just happy paths, but failure scenarios
  6. Integration Points: Testing actual integrations, not mocked
  7. Performance Awareness: Tests that catch performance regressions
  8. Security First: Permission and data isolation tests throughout
  9. History Tracking: Comprehensive testing of all history/audit trails
  10. Relationship Management: Testing complex doctype relationships
