Enterprise Migration: Custom Department Hierarchy to Native ERPNext Expense System

This comprehensive migration script transitions the Verenigingen system from a custom
department-based expense approval hierarchy to ERPNext's native expense management
framework. The migration ensures data integrity while improving system maintainability
and leveraging ERPNext's built-in expense workflows.

Migration Objectives:
    * Eliminate custom department hierarchy dependencies
    * Implement direct expense approver assignments based on volunteer team structure
    * Ensure board members have appropriate expense approval permissions
    * Provide comprehensive testing and validation capabilities
    * Support rollback operations for safe deployment

Technical Approach:
    The migration leverages the existing volunteer team assignment system to determine
    appropriate expense approvers, eliminating the need for maintaining parallel
    department structures. This approach aligns with the organization's volunteer-based
    operational model while utilizing ERPNext's proven expense management capabilities.

Migration Phases:
    1. Employee Record Updates: Direct expense_approver assignment
    2. Department Dependency Removal: Clean elimination of custom departments
    3. Permission Management: Board member expense approver role assignment
    4. Validation Testing: Comprehensive approver assignment verification
    5. Cleanup Operations: Optional removal of legacy department structures

Safety Features:
    * Comprehensive error handling and logging
    * Transaction safety with rollback capabilities
    * Extensive validation and testing procedures
    * Detailed progress reporting and audit trails
    * Optional cleanup operations for controlled deployment

Usage Examples:
    python migrate_to_native_expense_system.py          # Full migration
    python migrate_to_native_expense_system.py cleanup  # Remove legacy departments
    python migrate_to_native_expense_system.py test     # Validate expense workflows
