1. **Always backup data first**
2. Test on development environment before production
3. Review what the script will do before running
4. Monitor for errors during execution
5. Validate results after completion

## Adding Migration Scripts

When adding migration scripts:

1. Include detailed documentation of what is migrated
2. Add validation checks before and after migration
3. Make scripts resumable if possible
4. Include rollback procedures where applicable
5. Log all changes for audit purposes
