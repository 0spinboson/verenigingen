# Team Assignment History Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented automatic volunteer assignment history tracking for team assignments, making it work exactly like board member assignments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Centralized Assignment History Manager
**File**: `verenigingen/utils/assignment_history_manager.py`

A new centralized manager that handles assignment history for both board positions and team assignments consistently:

- `add_assignment_history()` - Adds active assignment when volunteer joins
- `complete_assignment_history()` - Completes assignment when volunteer leaves  
- `get_active_assignments()` - Gets current active assignments
- `remove_assignment_history()` - Removes assignment (for cancellations)

### 2. Refactored Board Manager
**File**: `verenigingen/verenigingen/doctype/chapter/managers/board_manager.py`

Updated the board manager to use the centralized assignment history manager:
- `add_volunteer_assignment_history()` now uses `AssignmentHistoryManager.add_assignment_history()`
- `update_volunteer_assignment_history()` now uses `AssignmentHistoryManager.complete_assignment_history()`

### 3. Completely Rewrote Team Assignment Logic
**File**: `verenigingen/verenigingen/doctype/team/team.py`

Replaced the old broken assignment logic with a proper system that mirrors board assignments:

#### Key Methods Added:
- `before_save()` - Stores document state for comparison
- `handle_team_member_changes()` - Detects changes and triggers history updates
- `add_team_assignment_history()` - Adds assignment when volunteer joins team
- `complete_team_assignment_history()` - Completes assignment when volunteer leaves team

#### How It Works:
1. **When team is saved**: `before_save()` stores the previous state
2. **After save**: `on_update()` calls `handle_team_member_changes()`
3. **Change detection**: Compares old vs new team members
4. **History tracking**: 
   - New active members → Add active assignment history
   - Deactivated members → Complete assignment history with end date
   - Removed members → Complete assignment history

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
**File**: `verenigingen/tests/test_team_assignment_history.py`

Created full test suite covering:
- Assignment history manager functionality
- Team assignment integration
- Edge cases and cleanup

## How It Works Now

### When You Assign a Volunteer to a Team:
1. Save the team with the new team member
2. System detects the new assignment
3. Automatically adds an **Active** entry to the volunteer's `assignment_history`:
   ```python
   {
     "assignment_type": "Team",
     "reference_doctype": "Team", 
     "reference_name": "Marketing Team",
     "role": "Content Writer",
     "start_date": "2025-06-12",
     "status": "Active"
   }
   ```

### When You Remove/Deactivate a Team Member:
1. Set `is_active = 0` or remove from team members
2. Save the team  
3. System detects the change
4. Automatically updates the assignment history to **Completed**:
   ```python
   {
     "assignment_type": "Team",
     "reference_doctype": "Team",
     "reference_name": "Marketing Team", 
     "role": "Content Writer",
     "start_date": "2025-06-12",
     "end_date": "2025-07-15",
     "status": "Completed"
   }
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Experience**: Team assignments now work exactly like board member assignments
2. **Automatic Tracking**: No manual intervention needed - history is tracked automatically
3. **Multiple Stints**: Supports volunteers rejoining teams multiple times
4. **Centralized Logic**: Both board and team assignments use the same robust history manager
5. **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and error handling
6. **Full Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests ensure reliability

## Verification

Run the tests to verify functionality:
```bash
bench --site [your-site] run-tests --app verenigingen --module verenigingen.tests.test_team_assignment_history
```

You should see:
- ✅ Assignment history manager tests pass
- ✅ Team assignment integration tests pass  
- ✅ "Found team assignment: Team - [Role Name]" confirmation

## Usage

The system now works automatically:

1. **Assign volunteer to team**: Assignment history is created automatically
2. **Remove volunteer from team**: Assignment history is completed automatically  
3. **View volunteer's history**: Check the `assignment_history` table in the Volunteer doctype

Team assignments now appear in volunteer assignment history exactly like board member assignments do!
