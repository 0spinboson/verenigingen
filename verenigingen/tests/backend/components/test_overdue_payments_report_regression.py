        REGRESSION TEST: Fix for UnboundLocalError in Overdue Member Payments report
        
        Bug: UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'today' where it is not associated with a value
        
        Root Cause: Duplicate imports of 'today' function (global + local) caused scope confusion
        
        Fix: Removed redundant local import of 'today' function inside the report function
        
        This test ensures the report can be imported and executed without import-related errors.
