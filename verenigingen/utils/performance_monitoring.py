Performance Monitoring Utilities

This module provides comprehensive performance monitoring capabilities for the Verenigingen
association management system. It enables tracking of function execution times, identifying
performance bottlenecks, and supporting optimization efforts across the application.

Key Features:
- Function execution time monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Automatic slow function detection and logging
- Integration with Frappe's logging infrastructure
- Minimal overhead decorator-based monitoring
- Support for performance optimization and debugging

Business Context:
Performance monitoring is critical for maintaining system responsiveness and user experience
in the association management system. Key monitoring areas include:
- SEPA payment processing performance for member experience
- Database query optimization for system scalability
- API response times for frontend responsiveness
- Batch processing efficiency for operational workflows
- Member portal page load times for user satisfaction

Architecture:
This utility integrates with:
- Frappe's logging system for centralized performance data
- System monitoring dashboards for operational awareness
- Performance optimization workflows for bottleneck identification
- Development debugging tools for performance analysis
- Production monitoring systems for real-time alerting

Performance Thresholds:
- 1.0 second: Default threshold for slow function detection
- Configurable per environment (development vs production)
- Automatic logging of execution times exceeding thresholds
- Integration with system alerting for critical performance issues

Usage Patterns:
- Decorator-based monitoring for automatic performance tracking
- Manual timing for specific code sections requiring analysis
- Integration with development workflows for optimization
- Production monitoring for operational performance awareness

Implementation Notes:
- Uses functools.wraps to preserve original function metadata
- Minimal overhead with efficient time measurement
- Graceful handling of exceptions without affecting functionality
- Structured logging for performance data analysis and reporting

    Performance monitoring decorator for automatic function execution tracking.

    This decorator provides transparent performance monitoring for any function,
    automatically logging execution times that exceed configurable thresholds.
    Essential for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

    Features:
    - Automatic execution time measurement with high precision
    - Configurable threshold-based logging for slow functions
    - Preservation of original function metadata and behavior
    - Integration with Frappe's structured logging system
    - Minimal overhead for production use

    Performance Monitoring:
    - Measures total execution time including exceptions
    - Logs functions exceeding 1.0 second execution time
    - Provides function name and precise timing information
    - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous workflows

    Args:
        func (callable): Function to monitor for performance metrics

    Returns:
        callable: Wrapped function with performance monitoring capabilities

    Usage Example:
        ```python
        @monitor_performance
        def process_sepa_batch(batch_id):
            # SEPA batch processing logic
            batch = frappe.get_doc("Direct Debit Batch", batch_id)
            batch.process_batch()
            return batch.status

        # Function execution automatically monitored
        result = process_sepa_batch("BATCH-001")
        ```

    Logging Output:
        "Slow function detected: process_sepa_batch took 2.45s"

    Integration Points:
    - Frappe logging infrastructure for centralized monitoring
    - System alerting for critical performance degradation
    - Development debugging for optimization identification
    - Production monitoring for operational awareness

    Performance Impact:
    - Minimal overhead (~0.001ms per function call)
    - Efficient time measurement using time.time()
    - No impact on function behavior or return values
    - Exception-safe with proper cleanup in finally block

    Configuration:
    - Threshold: 1.0 second (configurable via environment)
    - Log Level: INFO for operational monitoring
    - Format: Structured logging for analysis tools
