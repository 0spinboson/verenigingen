Optimized Event Handlers for Phase 2.2
Targeted Event Handler Optimization

This module provides optimized event handlers that move heavy operations to
background processing while maintaining business logic integrity.

Based on Phase 2.1 baseline analysis:
- Payment entry submission: 0.156s (blocks UI - 3 heavy operations identified)
- Sales invoice submission: 0.089s (1 operation suitable for background)
- Target: 60-70% faster UI response times

Implementation Strategy:
1. Keep critical business validation synchronous (blocking)
2. Move heavy operations to background jobs (non-blocking)
3. Provide real-time user notifications for background completion
4. Maintain 100% business logic integrity
