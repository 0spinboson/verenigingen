"""
Patch to update existing Donation records to use standardized field names.

This patch handles the following field name changes in the Donation doctype:
- date → donation_date
- donation_status → status
- donation_campaign → campaign

The field names in the DocType JSON have been updated, but existing data
still references the old field names and needs to be migrated.
