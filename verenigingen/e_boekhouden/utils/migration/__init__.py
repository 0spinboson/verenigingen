E-Boekhouden Migration Package

This package contains modular components for E-Boekhouden migration:
- migration_orchestrator: Main coordination and progress tracking
- account_mapper: Chart of accounts and account creation logic
- transaction_processor: Invoice, payment, and journal entry processing
- quality_checker: Data quality validation and reporting

This replaces the monolithic 5000+ line migration file with focused,
maintainable modules.
