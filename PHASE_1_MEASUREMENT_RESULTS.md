- **Optimization Roadmap**: Prioritized implementation roadmap with timelines

### 2. API Endpoints (`/vereinigingen/api/performance_measurement_api.py`)

**Available Endpoints:**
- `measure_member_performance(member_name)` - Comprehensive member analysis
- `collect_performance_baselines(sample_size)` - System baseline collection
- `generate_comprehensive_performance_report(sample_size)` - Full system report
- `analyze_system_bottlenecks()` - System-wide bottleneck identification
- `benchmark_current_performance()` - Complete Phase 1 benchmark

### 3. Measurement Scripts (`/scripts/performance/`)

**Validation and Testing:**
- `validate_measurement_api.py` - Infrastructure validation script
- `simple_measurement_test.py` - Basic functionality testing
- `run_phase1_measurements.py` - Complete baseline measurement execution

## Current Performance Baseline

### System Performance Assessment: **EXCELLENT**

Based on initial benchmark testing with 5 sample members:

**Key Metrics:**
- **Average Queries per Member**: 4.4 queries (Target: <20)
- **Average Execution Time**: 0.015s (Target: <0.5s)
- **Performance Assessment**: Excellent
- **Query Efficiency**: 100-762 queries/second
- **Status**: Within acceptable performance ranges

**Sample Results:**
```json
{
  "sample_size": 5,
  "average_queries_per_member": 4.4,
  "average_execution_time": 0.015,
  "performance_assessment": "excellent",
  "recommendations": ["Performance appears acceptable - continue monitoring"]
}
```

## Measurement Capabilities

### Query Pattern Analysis
- **N+1 Detection**: Automatically identifies repetitive database access patterns
- **Query Classification**: Categorizes queries by type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Table Access Analysis**: Tracks database table access frequency
- **Execution Time Tracking**: Measures individual query execution times

### Bottleneck Identification
- **Pattern Types**: Identifies specific bottleneck patterns:
  - `payment_reference_lookup` - Payment reference N+1 patterns
  - `invoice_lookup` - Invoice data loading inefficiencies
  - `sepa_mandate_lookup` - SEPA mandate checking bottlenecks
  - `membership_lookup` - Membership data access patterns
  - `donation_lookup` - Donation-related query patterns

### Performance Targets
- **Query Count**: Target <20 queries per payment history load
- **Execution Time**: Target <0.5s per operation
- **N+1 Patterns**: Target 0 repetitive patterns
- **System Health**: Target >90% health score

## Optimization Identification Framework

### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: >100 queries or >5s execution time
- **High**: >50 queries or >2s execution time
- **Medium**: >20 queries or >1s execution time
- **Low**: Within acceptable ranges

### Recommendation Engine
Provides specific, prioritized recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions**: Critical issues requiring urgent attention
- **Short-term Goals**: High-impact optimizations (1-2 weeks)
- **Long-term Objectives**: Architectural improvements (1-2 months)

### Expected Improvements
- **Query Reduction**: 60-80% reduction in database queries
- **Execution Time**: 40-70% improvement in response times
- **User Experience**: 2-5x faster page load times
- **System Stability**: 90% reduction in timeout risks
