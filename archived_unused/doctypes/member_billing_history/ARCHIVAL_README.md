# Member Billing History DocType - Archived

**Archived Date**: 2025-08-08
**Reason**: Unused/unimplemented DocType

## Background

The Member Billing History DocType was created as a placeholder during billing system development but was never fully implemented:

1. **Created**: Commit c6df306 during billing system refactor
2. **Implementation Status**: Only Python class stub created, no JSON definition
3. **Usage**: Never used in production code
4. **Alternative**: Member Payment History and Member Fee Change History handle actual tracking needs

## What was archived

- `member_billing_history.py` - Empty Python class with just `pass`
- `__init__.py` - Standard Python package file

## Current Tracking Systems

The following are **active** and handle billing/payment tracking:

1. **Member Payment History** (Child Table):
   - Tracks invoice/payment lifecycle per member
   - Full JSON definition with comprehensive fields
   - Background job processing via Payment Entry events
   - Location: `verenigingen/doctype/member_payment_history/`

2. **Member Fee Change History** (Child Table):
   - Tracks dues rate changes and schedule modifications
   - Active usage in Member DocType
   - Location: `verenigingen/doctype/member_fee_change_history/`

## Potential Future Use

If billing event tracking is needed (separate from payments and fee changes), this DocType could be implemented to track:
- Invoice generation events
- Due date notifications sent
- Late payment penalties applied
- Billing frequency changes
- Collection attempt records

## Related Analysis

See:
- `PAYMENT_HISTORY_HOOKS_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete payment history integration
- `MISSING_DOCTYPE_JSON_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of incomplete DocTypes
- Git history analysis confirming it was never fully implemented

## Decision

Archived due to:
- No JSON definition ever created
- Never referenced in production code
- Functionality covered by existing active DocTypes
- Clean up of incomplete/unused code
