   - Higher profiles include lower profile permissions
   
3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Financial roles strictly separated
   - Audit roles are read-only
   - Personal data access limited by chapter/team

4. **Portal Access**:
   - All profiles include portal access
   - Member portal is default home for non-admin users
   - Volunteer portal for volunteer-enabled profiles

5. **Communication**:
   - Scoped by role and organizational unit
   - Members only see own communications
   - Leaders see team/chapter communications
