## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Pre-Deployment Validation**
Run the production validation to ensure system readiness:

```bash
bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute "verenigingen.verenigingen.doctype.contribution_amendment_request.contribution_amendment_request.validate_production_schema"
```

### 2. **System Health Check**
Verify core functionality:

```bash
bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute "verenigingen.verenigingen.doctype.contribution_amendment_request.contribution_amendment_request.test_enhanced_approval_workflows"
```

### 3. **Database Backup**
Create a full backup before any changes:

```bash
bench --site dev.veganisme.net backup --with-files
```

### 4. **Apply Final Migration**
Ensure all database changes are applied:

```bash
bench --site dev.veganisme.net migrate
bench --site dev.veganisme.net clear-cache
```

### 5. **Restart System**
Restart all services to ensure changes are loaded:

```bash
bench restart
```

### 6. **Post-Deployment Validation**
Run final validation to confirm deployment success:

```bash
bench --site dev.veganisme.net execute "verenigingen.verenigingen.doctype.contribution_amendment_request.contribution_amendment_request.test_enhanced_approval_workflows"
```
